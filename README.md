## Overview

Connect Four is a two-player connection board game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a 7-column, 6-row vertically suspended grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs. This implementation features an AI opponent that uses advanced game theory algorithms to provide a challenging experience.

## Algorithm

### Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning

The Minimax algorithm is used to determine the optimal move for the AI player. It works by recursively exploring the game tree, evaluating positions, and selecting moves that maximize the AI's chances of winning while assuming the opponent plays optimally.

Alpha-Beta pruning is an optimization technique for the Minimax algorithm that significantly reduces the number of nodes that need to be evaluated in the search tree.

Core implementation:

```python
def minimax(board, depth, alpha, beta, maximizing_player):
    valid_moves = get_valid_moves(board)
    
    # Convert board to hashable format
    board_tuple = tuple(tuple(row) for row in board)
    state_key = (board_tuple, depth, maximizing_player)

    # Check transposition table
    if state_key in transposition_table:
        return transposition_table[state_key]

    # Check terminal conditions
    is_terminal = is_terminal_node(board)
    if depth == 0 or is_terminal:
        if is_terminal:
            if winning_move(board, AI_PIECE):
                result = (None, 10000000)
            elif winning_move(board, PLAYER_PIECE):
                result = (None, -1000000)
            else:
                result = (None, 0)
        else:
            result = (None, score_position(board, AI_PIECE))
        transposition_table[state_key] = result
        return result
    
    # Maximizing player (AI)    
    if maximizing_player:
        value = -math.inf
        column = None
        sorted_moves = sort_valid_moves_with_boards(valid_moves, board, AI_PIECE)
        for col, _, board_copy in sorted_moves:
            new_score = minimax(board_copy, depth-1, alpha, beta, False)[1]
            if new_score > value:
                value = new_score
                column = col
            alpha = max(alpha, value)
            if alpha >= beta:
                break
        transposition_table[state_key] = (column, value)
        return column, value
    
    # Minimizing player (opponent)
    else:
        value = math.inf
        column = None
        sorted_moves = sort_valid_moves_with_boards(valid_moves, board, PLAYER_PIECE)
        for col, _, board_copy in sorted_moves:
            new_score = minimax(board_copy, depth-1, alpha, beta, True)[1]
            if new_score < value:
                value = new_score
                column = col
            beta = min(beta, value)
            if alpha >= beta:
                break
        transposition_table[state_key] = (column, value)
        return column, value
```

### Optimizations

**1. Transposition Table**

```python
# Check transposition table
if state_key in transposition_table:
    return transposition_table[state_key]
```

The transposition table stores previously calculated positions to avoid redundant calculations, greatly improving performance.

**2. Move Ordering**

```python
def sort_valid_moves_with_boards(valid_moves, board, piece):
    scored_moves = []
    for col in valid_moves:
        row = get_next_open_row(board, col)
        if row != -1:
            board_copy = drop_piece(board, row, col, piece)
            score = score_position(board_copy, piece)
            scored_moves.append((col, score, board_copy))
    scored_moves.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return scored_moves
```

Moves are sorted by potential score, allowing Alpha-Beta pruning to work more efficiently by evaluating the most promising moves first.

**3. Memory Optimization**

```python
# Convert board to hashable format
board_tuple = tuple(tuple(row) for row in board)
state_key = (board_tuple, depth, maximizing_player)
```

Converting the board to tuples allows for efficient storage and lookup in the transposition table.

**4. Table Management**

```python
def manage_transposition_table():
    global transposition_table
    if len(transposition_table) > MAX_TABLE_SIZE:
        transposition_table.clear()
```

Prevents memory issues by clearing the transposition table when it becomes too large.

## Future Development

Future improvements planned for this project include:
- Implementation of Reinforcement Learning techniques
- Online multiplayer capabilities
- Implementation of additional AI algorithms for comparison
- Performance benchmarking and optimization

### Reinforcement Learning Plans

We plan to enhance the AI with reinforcement learning by:
1. Setting up a game environment following standards like `OpenAI` `Gym`
2. Defining a reward system (+1 for `wins`, -1 for `losses`, 0 for `intermediate moves`)
3. Implementing experience collection during gameplay
4. Training the agent using `Q-Learning` or `Deep Q-Networks (DQN)`
5. Evaluating and optimizing the agent's performance
